      <p>We receive hundreds of applicants a year here at Camp Thailand, many with a shared interest in the program: to embark on an elephant advent and make a difference to the lives of Thai elephants during a visit to a local elephant sanctuary. During this time, participants bathe, feed and care for elephants who may otherwise have been exposed to cruelty. Did you know the following elephant facts about the much heralded animal?</p>

      <p>1. There are currently around 4,000 elephants in Thailand, a huge decrease from the 1850s, when 100,000 elephants roamed the country.</p>
      <p>2. Tragically, the numbers of Asian elephants have reduced; they are now classified as endangered according to the World Conservation Union’s (IUCN’s) Red List of Threatened Animals. Centuries of hunting and the destruction of their natural habitat caused this dramatic reduction in the elephant population.</p>
      <p>3. Many of the male elephants were hunted and poached for the ivory in their tusks. In 1989, Thailand joined the rest of the globe in instituting a ban on elephant ivory in an attempt to protect the animals.</p>
      <p>4. Although they’re some of the biggest animals on earth, elephants are actually herbivores.</p>
      <p>5. How complex is an elephant’s trunk? Each trunk has more than 40,000 muscles, more than all the muscles in a human body combined!</p>
      <p>6. Asian elephants are grey, a colour that acts as a natural defence by allowing them to blend into the shade of their natural habitats.</p>
      <p>7. Elephants are extremely social, and are healthiest and happiest when they have daily physical contact and communication with other elephants.</p>
      <p>8. Elephants have skin that’s up to 1 inch thick, but is still sensitive to the sun.</p>
      <p>10. Even though they’re such huge creatures, elephants are silent when they walk, due to their wide, padded feet.</p>

      <p>In the eyes of many travellers, Thailand embodies the perfect travel opportunity, with amazing food, stunning beaches and delightful culture. The Asian island continues to attract visitors from across the globe; here are just a handful of fun Thailand facts: </p>

      <p>1. Every year, more than six million foreign tourists travel to Thailand, which makes it one of the most visited countries in the world.</p>
      <p>2. Thailand is home to the Craseonycteris Thonglongyai (the bumble bat), the world’s smallest mammal.</p>
      <p>3. Mudskippers originate from Thailand, one of the world’s most interesting species. Even though they are fish, Mudskippers can walk onto land using their fin to drive their body and even climb trees. Unlike any other fish, they absorb oxygen through their skin.</p>
      <p>4. The population of Thailand is 69,189,398, which ranks it as the 20th most populated country in the world.</p>
      <p>5. 75% of Thailand’s population are Thai, 14% Chinese, and 11% other, including residents from other Asian countries as well as a significant population from Europe, Australia, the U.S., U.K., and other nations.</p>
      <p>6. One-tenth of all the animal species on earth live in Thailand.</p>
      <p>7. Thailand is the top orchid exporter in the world, with more than 1,500 species of orchids growing wild in the country.</p>
      <p>8. Thailand is home to a remarkable 1,430 islands, the most famous of which is Koh Phi Phi, which was featured in the movie The Beach.</p>
      <p>9. Thailand used to be known for its abundant elephant population with more than 100,000 of them roaming around a century ago. But now, there are only about 4,000 elephants in Thailand, less than half of them are in the wild.</p>
      <p>10. Known as the Land of Smiles, Thailand is ranked as the 13th friendliest country in the world according to the World Economic Forum.</p>
